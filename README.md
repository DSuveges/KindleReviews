# Motivation

I love to read and I love my Kindle e-book reader. I really think that electronic books have revolutionize reading. As over the years, I bought around ten devices for family and friends, I saw how dramatic developments occured. It is almost quite impossible to find any space for further developments. I was courious how the opinion of customers have changed over time and over the these striking developments.

On the other hand answering this question provided me a great opportunity to get an exposure in python and its powerful libraries: pandas, numpy and matplotlib.
